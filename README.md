# Titanic Survival Prediction
In this project, we aim to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. We will perform exploratory data analysis on the provided dataset to gain insights into the various features of the passengers and their relationship with survival. We will then engineer new features and use various machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Data
The dataset provided contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, cabin, fare, and whether they survived or not.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
We will analyze the features of the passengers and their relationship with survival using visualizations and statistical analysis. We will also identify and handle missing values and outliers in the dataset.

## Feature Engineering
We will create new features from the existing data to improve the performance of our machine learning models. These new features could include age groups, family size, cabin deck, and title.

## Modeling
We will use various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting to predict the survival of passengers. We will also use a voting procedure to combine the predictions of multiple models and improve the overall accuracy.

## Conclusion
By performing exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and using various machine learning models, we will aim to accurately predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The results of this project can be useful for understanding the factors that contributed to the survival of passengers and can also be applied to similar classification problems in other domains.
